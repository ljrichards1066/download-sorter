This simple sorting application was written to be functional but also so I could start learning GO. The app will check the current directory, and sort files by extension into folders named after that extension. It will create a log file in the same directory, and will avoid moving itself or the logfile during the sorting process. Windows and Unix versions are available, or you can build from the .go file.
